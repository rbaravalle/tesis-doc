	others suffer from the combined error of the perimeter and area measurements
	of the fragmented patches. In this article – using a theoretical
	model and a worked example – we would like to show that the Korcak-plot
	(and the corresponding fractal dimension, the Korcak-dimension) is
	not only a proper way to describe patchiness, but also applicable
	to detect secondary processes, like re-forestation, following the
